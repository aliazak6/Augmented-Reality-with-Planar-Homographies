# Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies
Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies implementations with python
I used CMU 16-385 assignment 2 as my guideline and implemented the desired functions.

HarryPotterize.py script takes reference image and calculates homography with given context. \
Afterwards using the homography any new image can be warped. \
ar.py script uses this approach to implement warping operation in video file. \
